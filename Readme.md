**Technical details**


This is realized by live editing the vertexes of a Three.JS model via a bump map
and then directly capturing the resulting modified graphic vertices from the graphic buffer. Then the model is converted them to an STL object and exported.
This is more a demo of what is possible with Three.JS - if you accidentally design a ring you like it would be awesome.
